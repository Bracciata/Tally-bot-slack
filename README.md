# Tally-bot-slack
I created this slack bot because I noticed there was not at the time a bot that could be used to keep score. This bot has the ability to keep score by adding one or multiple tallys at a time or taking away a tally. Instead of using a database I instead just have it scan messages sent which could be used to manipulate the bot, but do not fear for it is not in production and you can also use the set command to set the score.

Foundations for this bot based off of the slack bot found at https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html
